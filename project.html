        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>Is there a definite correlation between a country's Healthcare spending(as a % of GDP) and its average Life Expectancy? If this is isn't always the case, what are some of the causes for these deviations?</p>
        <div class="myWeek5">
        <p>The aim of this project is to identify whether there is a relationship between a countries life expectancy
            and its healthcare spending.  I will then attempt to identify some key factors 
             as to why this is. I hope to conclude that there are some defining factors in the reasons for these differences, 
             offering an insight into areas countries may need to explore in order to improve their nations life expectancy.</p>
    
       <h2>Comparing Global Life expectancies</h2>

         
        <p>Health care spending</p>
        <p>Before analysing the relationship between healthcare spending and average life expectancy I thought
            it would be useful to create 2 maps displaying the disparities in 
        both across the globe. </p>

        <h2>Global life expectancy </h2>

        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FdQAIngaSg4O9hQ9C7pBSkbrM6okK8U6?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>
        <p>I have used this data for Life Expectancy as my master dataset, merging it with multiple other datasets in order to draw further conclusions.</p>


        <div class="mapchart" id="Hworldchart"></div>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q4QYc88ocYN-YZ_dyy2Ngt8ZGE-GUhH5?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>
        <p>This Second Map shows Healthcare spending as a % of GDP. From comparison of the two maps it is clear that Spending on Healthcare does not guarantee a higher Life Expectancy. </p>

     

        <h2>Correlation between healthcare spending and
                life expectancy
        </h2>
        <p>I then went on to combine these datasets and run a regression. In order to do this I first cleaned each dataset in excel and python, ensuring variable names, varibale types and country names were identical. I then converted the data 
            sets into TIDY format before merging them on the variable 'country name' and then  cleaning the new dataset. </p>
        <div class="chart" id="LGDPchart"></div>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q4QYc88ocYN-YZ_dyy2Ngt8ZGE-GUhH5?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>
        <p>The regression showed that there is a positive relationsip, however, it was not as strong as anticpated and the data consistent of multiple outliers.
        </p>

        <p>The disparity between the US and China led me to investigate the relationship in both countries further. </p>
        <h3> China vs the US timeseries</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="UScfinalchart"></div>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hLMPtjEip2yFuEGh-089p4ClTEVRxkzT?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>
        <p>I decided to compare Per Capita Healthcare Spending with the Life Expectancy of both countries over time. This meant I had to repeat my data cleaning and merging process. When producing this graph I came across some issues with the layer encoding that I was able to sort by reordering some of my code.</p>
        <p>I feel this is a really useful graph as it shows a consistently large difference in healthcare spending per capita but converging Average Life Expectancies, with little difference in 2019. </p>

        

        <p>This motivated me to investigate other potential reasons for the differences in countries average life expectancy.</p>
        <p>I first combined my master data with a cleaned dataset containing countries pollution levels. I felt it would be useful to also display the population size of each country, with opacity allowing for denser areas to show larger denser populations. </p>

        <h2> Pollution against Life Expectancy</h2>
        <div class="chart" id="polchart"></div>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NUQgf7msewSpGdhDoSf5ckHJnyiG8BH7?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>
        <p>There is clear negative correlation between a countries
            pollution levels and life expectancy. It
            seems reasonable to assume that pollution may lead to decreasing life expectancies.
        </p>

        <h3> Religion against Life Expectancy</h3>
        <p>As  data on how religous the average person feels in a country was not readily available, I had to scrape it using Pandas and Requests. I then cleaned it before merging it with my master dataset.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="religionchart"></div>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JCVGlT5No3k-hZKloKNwJSMukdf6u08L?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>
        

        <p>The graph shows there is also a clear negative correlation between how religous
            a country is on average and its average Life Expectancy. However as less 
            developed countries tend to be more religous and with studies showing that 
            people who feel religous live for longer, this may only be correlation and not causation.
        </p>

       


        <p> Due to the wide accessibility of the data I needed, accessing APIâ€™s was widely unnecessary.</p>

        <h3>Problems with data and graphs</h3>
        <p>For my first graph I attempted to use additional data containing the life expectancy of males and females . I created a dummy variable for males, females and combined average Life Expectancy but when adding the encoding for the slider I was met with a consistent error that I was unable to fix.</p>
        <p>I also scraped and cleaned data sets for male and female alcohol consumpiton, however when producing graphs there was no clear message so I
        I chose not to   include them. </p>

        <p>I also attempted to use beautiful soup in order to scrape lists of countries in accordance to their Healthcare systems. This proved difficult due to the list formating of the data and I was therefore unsuccessful in doing so. </p>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y3_UWzqwVV57J8kpOO89zqQWU4zV-Cm6?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>



        

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I have concluded that although healthcare spending is correlated with the average life expectancy of a country, it is the not the only significant factor. Pollution and Religion appear to have more signifcant relationships with a countries average life expectancy.
             When carrying on this research it would be useful to carry out further regressions accounting for multiple variables in order to specify the effect of changes in specific factors. There are also mulitple other factors i would wish to explore such as population demographics and Healthcare systems. </p>
