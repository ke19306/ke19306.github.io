        <p>The aim of this project is to assess the differences in countries life expectancies 
            across the globe and to then attempt to identify differing factors that affect these
             life expectancy’s. Countries that rate similarly on the Human development Index do not
             always necessarily have entirely similar life expectancy’s, I will attempt to identify some key factors 
             as to why this is. I hope to conclude that there are some defining factors in the reasons for these differences, 
             offering an insight into areas countries may need to explore in order to improve their life expectancy.</p>
    
       <h2>Comparing Global Life expectancy's</h2>

         <p> I am going to do my project on differences in country's Life expectancy's</p>
         <p>Looking into Contrast in the US and China</p>

         
        <p>Health care spending</p>
        <p>Before analysing variances in Life Expectancy I thought
            it would be useful to create a map displaying variance in 
        Life Expectancy across the globe </p>

        <h2>Global life expectancy </h2>

        <div class="mapchart" id="Hworldchart"></div>

     

        <h2>Correlation between healthcare spending
                Life expectancy
        </h2>
        <div class="chart" id="LGDPchart"></div>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q4QYc88ocYN-YZ_dyy2Ngt8ZGE-GUhH5?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>

        <h3> China vs the usa</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="UScfinalchart"></div>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hLMPtjEip2yFuEGh-089p4ClTEVRxkzT?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>

        <p>The differences in Healthcare spending between 
            the Us and China but relative similarity in Life
            Expectancy shows that there are other Factors at play.

        </p>

        <h2> Pollution against Life Expectancy</h2>
        <div class="chart" id="polchart"></div>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NUQgf7msewSpGdhDoSf5ckHJnyiG8BH7?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>
        <p>There is clear negative correlation between a countries
            pollution levels and Life Expactancy. It
            seems reasonable to assume this pollution aslo causation.
        </p>

        <h3> Religion against Life Expectancy</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="religionchart"></div>
        <p class="rubric-launch"> <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JCVGlT5No3k-hZKloKNwJSMukdf6u08L?usp=sharing"> Collab</a> </p>

        <p>There is also a clear negative correlation between how Religous
            a country is on average and its Life Expectancy. However as less 
            Developed country tend to be more religous and studied actually show that 
            people who feel religous live for longer, this may not be causation.
        </p>

        <p>Both religion </p>


        <p>For this Project I have used a variety of data. I have downloaded CSV files,
            scraped API’s and…. Many of my charts contain multiple Datasets  that I have
             merged on python. In doing this I came across multiple issues such as, differing
            variable types, names and sizes. All of these issues I have dealt with by cleaning
             the data in Python. I used data from world population review for my Life expectancy.
            I initially cleaned this in excel before using python to convert it into long form,
            in order to present the differences between male and female life countries for each country.
            Due to the wide accessibility of the data I needed, accessing API’s was widely unnecessary.
             However, for my graph that looks into the effects of religion on Life expectancy.
             I scraped data using pandas and requests in order to scrape the table I required.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
